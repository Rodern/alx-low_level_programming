# C Programming - ALX SE

This repository contains code and script for a ALX SE projects on C programming. The project covers topics such as variables, conditional statements (if/else), and while loops.

## Variables

In C, a variable is a named location in memory that can store a value of a specific data type. Variables have a name (also called an identifier) and a data type, which determines the type of values that can be stored in the variable. For example, an `int` variable can store integer values, while a `char` variable can store character values.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statement in C is the `if` statement, which has the following syntax:

```c
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
