# ALX SE - Low Programming Nested Functions and Loops

## Project Description

This project, named alx-low_level_programming from ALX SE, is a collection of tasks written in C that focus on nested loops, functions, and if conditions. The aim is to provide a practical understanding of how these concepts work in C programming.

## Introduction

The tasks in this project cover various aspects of nested loops, functions, and if conditions in C programming, including but not limited to:

- **Nested Loops**: Understanding the syntax and usage of nested 'for' and 'while' loops in C.
- **Nested Functions**: Exploring how functions can be nested within other functions.
- **If Conditions**: Learning how to use 'if' conditions for decision making in programs.

Each task is contained in its own sub-file within the project.

## Installation

To get started with these tasks, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodern/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory containing the task you want to run. Compile the C file using gcc, then run the output file:

```bash
gcc taskfile.c -o taskfile
./taskfile
```

Replace ‘taskfile’ with the name of the task file you want to run.
